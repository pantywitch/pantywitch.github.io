    <h2>what is this?</h2>

    <p>
      this is a website that i threw together so that i can have a place to just toss all my half finished projects for ease of linking them to people.  it's easier to explore what i do when it's all in one place, anyway.
      <br>
      the name sad slut club was a joke that I took way too far and now i'm emotionally attached to this domain. plus <<code>.club</code> domains are cheap as fuck.
      <br>
      the ttrpgs, writing, and art links are all broken and i'm sure i'll get to putting something there tomorrow.
