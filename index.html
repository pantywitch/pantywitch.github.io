    <h2>What is this?</h2>

    <p>
      This is a website that I threw together so that I can have a place to just toss all my half finished projects for ease of linking them to people.  It's easier to explore what I do when it's all in one place, anyway.  I've also decided to document some aspects of my mental illness here, because I think it's especially useful for me to write a lot of it down.

      The name Sad Slut Club was a joke that I took way too far and now I'm emotionally attached to this domain. Plus, <code>.club</code> domains are cheap as fuck.

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>

    <p>
      I'm Selkie / Charlotte.  I do a wide variety of things like art, tabletop nonsense, light gamedev, and writing.  Selkie is a handle that I came up with in 2016 and it has stuck ever since.  For my art, specifically, I use the username <code>pantywitch</code> or some variation thereof because I think it's cute, and Selkie is often taken.
