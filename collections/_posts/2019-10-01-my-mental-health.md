short_description: About Me, or, The State of my Mental Health
---
Writing is hard.  I love writing.  I hate writing about myself.  I spent a week deciding what to write or if I even should.  I spent a little less than a week wondering if I started writing that my family would think I'm crazy and stop talking to me.  I have no reason to believe this.  My dad is a writer, my family is crazy. They already know that I'm crazy.  I don't share a lot with my family about my health, especially my mental health, because it's scary.  It's so scary.

But I should.  How can anyone help me if they don't know what's going on?  

I have always been anxious.  I was anxious as a child, as a teenager, and as an adult.  My anxiety got really, *really* bad when I was in 7th grade.  I have no idea if this is accurate, but it felt like the first semester I was fine, and the second semester everything started falling apart.  I saw some doctors at some point, and in the nebulous period between ages 13 and 16, I had tried on a lot of medications and a lot of diagnoses and potential diagnoses.  They didn't stick.  The doctors thought they stuck, and my family thought they stuck, but they weren't right.  I knew they weren't right.  But the medication helped me and that was good enough.  I don't think any medication has helped me with my anxiety, even medications specifically made for treating anxiety, but they helped with psychosis, which I had a lot of issues with during high school.  I attacked the same dude two years in a row!  I tried to jump out of cars!  I had panic attacks multiple times a week, sometimes a day.  I wouldn't go to class sometimes, I'd sit in the counselor's office all day or stare out of the window at the snow and wonder what it would be like to fall asleep in it.  That was 9th grade.

It concluded, mostly, when I went to a special education school.  A "special education center", if you will.  I liked it there, even though I still missed school frequently.  I have no idea what was on my mind those years but I know it was bad.  That school helped.  I graduated on time, I did well on my ACT even though I never took a real math class.  I went to community college for a year and then moved to California to live with my partner.  In an interesting turn of events, she *does* have Bipolar Disorder.

When I moved, I got a new psychiatrist.  I liked her, but after I told her I had been previously diagnosed with Bipolar or Bipolar-lite or whatever, she asked me a lot of questions and then agreed with that diagnosis.  It felt like a stretch.  She asked specific questions and I gave wishy-washy answers, and the diagnosis still felt wrong. (It was!)  Still, I switched medication a few times and gained a lot of weight and then I stopped taking everything in August, or maybe it was September.  I was exhausted from having a large number of side-effects with little benefit.  It wasn't whatever Bipolar nonsense I had been diagnosed with keeping me from going to work every shift, it was anxiety.  

After a lot of fighting with my partner, I moved back to Michigan for a few months in November of last year, after living in California for a few months over a year.  In Michigan, I spoke to a behavioral specialist about what I thought was wrong with me.  Borderline Personality Disorder can be abbreviated the same way as Bipolar Disorder, and it even has some similar symptoms.  It can't be primarily treated with medication, instead, it can be treated with a specialized therapy called DBT.  DBT is skills building.  DBT is about keeping you in the present and aware of what you're feeling so that you can better control it.  She recommended a DBT workbook and I got it, in January.  Only this week am I going to be doing any of it with my therapist.

Borderline (BPD) comes with mood swings.  They are much more rapid than Bipolar, lasting only a few hours or days.  It comes with an uncertain identity. For me, this means my interests are only semi-solid, the way I type and speak are malleable.  It means that when my partner is upset, *I* am upset, too.  It's incredibly difficult modeling my mood and behavior after someone else, but it's more difficult because I don't know how to feel things myself.  She's my favorite person, and it's a bad, terrible thing, and not because she did anything wrong.  BPD comes with black and white thinking and a concept called splitting, where I flip between idealizing and devaluing the people I love.  They're either the best people I know or they are devils in disguise.  It is very difficult for her because anything can spawn this idea, whether it's in her control or not.

I started going to school again this fall after not attending for about two years.  I immediately dislocated my kneecap in some weird freak accident involving nothing more than walking a dog I had adopted just an hour beforehand.  I was forced to drop out of my yoga class and missed - and am still missing - many other class sessions because of the pain or because I miscalculated how much time it would take me to walk to the bus stop a tenth of a mile away.

I received a second mental illness diagnosis last week from a therapist I know, like, and trust enough to pay $120 a session until I finally call and switch my Medi-Cal provider to something she takes.  This diagnosis was Schizophrenia.  She didn't apply it to me, exactly.  It was more like an unwanted gift and I was free to take it and apply it to myself if it made things easier.  Schizophrenia is a hard label, just like BPD, and having both is nightmarish.  I was diagnosed under the criteria of delusions and thought disorders, along with very poor executive function and working memory.  I will get into the delusions in a second, but the thought disorders are the most apparent when interacting with me.  Thought disorders affect speech and writing.  From the John Hopkins Medicine POC-IT Guides, the main descriptors affecting me are:
- **Poverty of content of speech**: adequate speech quantity with prominent vagueness and inappropriate level of abstraction
- **Distractible speech**: topic maintenance difficulties due to distraction by nearby stimulus
- **Tangentiality**: Replies to questions are off-point or totally irrelevant.
- **Derailment (loosening of associations**: spontaneous speech with marked impairments in topic maintenance
- **Illogicality**: marked errors in inferential logic
- **Word approximations**: unconventional and idiosyncratic word use
- **Circumstantiality**: excessively indirect speech; speech is liable to be overinclusive and include irrelevant detail
- **Loss of goal**: difficulty in topic maintenance in reference to failure to arrive at the implicit goal of a statement
- **Perseveration**: excessive repetition of words, ideas, or subjects
- **Blocking**: interruption of speech while ostensibly in pursuit of a goal
- **Self-reference**: The patient is liable to refer the subject of conversation back to him/herself.
- **Paraphasic error (phonemic)**: word mispronunciation, slip of the tongue
- **Paraphasic error (semantic)**: substitution of an inappropriate word to make a specific statement

Does this seem familiar?  It's incredibly difficult to hide the fact that I have severe difficulty with a lot of normally straightforward things, including understanding what other people are saying and making inferences based on common sense or knowledge.  It's also painfully obvious when you hear me speak, as I absentmindedly replace words with other potentially related (but often not) words, or with something I am also thinking about or looking at while I'm speaking.  I even do this when I am typing.

The second part is delusions, which are much easier to hide.  I don't remember if I had many delusions before this year, but they came full force most dangerously this spring.  The delusions I had in spring rarely come up in the present.  I was like a volcano, erupting for reasons very well known to me and unfathomable for the Roman villagers on my mountain slopes, (a very abstract metaphor for my roommates and partner.)  These extreme psychotic episodes came with extreme delusions.  I was convinced that I was a demon and needed God to smite me down, that everything around me was fake and the second I started believing in it that they would kill me.  I believed that my brain had been switched with someone else's because the intensity of this was so terrifying that I could not believe it was coming from myself.  I spent multiple months hitting my head as hard as I could on the wall.  There are some light dents in my apartment because of this.  I wanted to break open my skull and take the wrong brain out because only *then* I'd feel better.  I saw a therapist for a few months but, like many therapy appointments I had with anyone but my current therapist, nothing was accomplished.  Eventually, I just stopped going to him and started seeing my current one sporadically - I had seen her for a few months the previous year, but while my thought disorder was relevant, I was not having delusions.

I now mainly have delusions that are reality-adjacent, something believable but untrue.  That I am being cheated on, or that my friends and family talk to each other behind my back to say terrible things.  I have a few that are not reality-adjacent - that I am an alien, or that the government is changing my medical records.  I'm sure there are other things I believe that I have not yet realized are delusions. Even the fact that I know and notice that these are delusions does not affect whether or not they show up or begin invading my thoughts.  It feels as if there is a separate entity from my thinking and my brain, and wresting complete control over both is difficult.  I can be actively delusional *and* actively knowing, realizing, and countering my delusions - they stick, and that corner of my brain still tries to collect evidence as if to prove to myself that it is true.

I have been meaning to call my psychiatrist again to get medication because with thought disorders and delusions it's incredibly difficult to do effective therapy. I have no idea how to juggle school, my thoughts, my illness, my injuries.  I have no idea how to get better. I want to get better.  It's so hard.  It's so hard.  It's so hard.
